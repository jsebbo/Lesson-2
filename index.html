		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>My name is Jack Sebastian, I live in South Queensferry. I am here at Sighthill to study           Software and Web Design. Currently, I am employed at Marks and Spencer's on Princes st and        I have been working there for about two years now. In my spare time I like to watch the           football and play games on xbox with friends.</p>
